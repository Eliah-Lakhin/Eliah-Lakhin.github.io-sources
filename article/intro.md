My name is Ilya Lakhin, and I am independent software developer from Russia.

I had been working as a web developer for various IT companies and start-ups
around the world since 2007. And my professional expertise includes a number of
front-end and back-end technologies.

But my interest is not limited to web development only. My another big passion
is tools made for other software engineers. Such as programming language
compilers, IDEs, and code editors. Now I am working on my own set of programming
[instruments](/projects/). With a final purpose to make a full-feature
development environment that will run right on the Web. And I hope it will
raise software development to the new level.

On this site I maintain my [web logs](/blog/) to highlight my projects, and
thoughts on IT and life in Russia.
