## Education

**Novosibirsk State University**, _Physics and Mathematics faculty_, _Bachelor_, _Sept 2005 – June 2009_

[The university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk_State_University) was founded by the world-famous soviet scientists Mikhail Lavrentiev and Sergei Sobolev. Novosibirsk State University is one of the most famous and acknowledged universities in Russia.
