My development plan for the nearest several months includes at least the
following steps:

1. [Papa Carlo](/projects/papa-carlo/). Constructor of incremental parsers in
Scala. Done and published.
2. **Malvina**. General purpose programming language and source-to-source
compiler based on top of Papa Carlo. The key idea is that developers can program
in one language, and then compile the source codes to other programming
languages. Such as Java, Objective-C, JavaScript. To have all the advantages
of these languages' platforms in one software product.
3. Framework in Malvina for development of user interfaces that will run out
of the box **natively** on various mobile platforms, in browser, and on desktops
at the same time.
4. Full-featured Malvina IDE that will run both, in browser and on desktop.

Maybe it looks too complicated for a single developer, but I already have
experience in all these fields. And moreover I have early prototypes of the
compiler and web IDE. For me it was kind of a hobby for years, and now I hope to
finish these things and bring them as ready to use products.

However at this moment I have only published the
[Papa Carlo](/projects/papa-carlo/), which will be a key role in all the other
projects.

Future updates will be highlighted in my [blog](/blog/).
