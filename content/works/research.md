Among other things I'm working on the modern development toolkit that includes a
number of related research projects:

1. [Papa Carlo](/projects/papa-carlo/). Constructor of incremental parsers in
Scala. It will become a core component of the future in-browser IDE.
Done and published.
2. [Malvina](https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/malvina-in-scala). General purpose
programming language and source-to-source compiler based on top of Papa Carlo
for crossplatform and crosslanguage micromodule development. Development is in
progress.
3. Full-featured IDE for mainstream languages with static types such as Java,
C#, C++, Objective-C that will run in browsers, on desktop, and as a non-gui
terminal-based editor. Also I plan to implement it as a headless compilation
server. Please, read
[related blog post](/blog/15.11.2013-handy-incremental-parser/) that highlights
this idea.
